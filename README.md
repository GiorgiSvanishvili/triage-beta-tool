# Triage Tool Beta

## What It Is

The **Triage Tool Beta** is a web app that helps healthcare providers decide if a patient needs **Emergency Room (ER) care** or can be **safely discharged**. It analyzes 9 patient features, like oxygen levels, blood pressure, and symptoms (e.g., chest pain), using machine learning.

**Benefits**:
- **Safe**: Detects 95.1% of ER cases, ensuring critical patients are identified.
- **Accurate**: Correctly predicts 92.3% of cases.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple web interface for entering patient data.

This beta uses synthetic data for testing. It predicts based on clinical rules (e.g., low oxygen or chest pain = ER). Future versions will use real patient data.
